# Major Release Workflow

When preparing for a major release, such as upgrading from **.NET 8** to **.NET 9**, there are several key steps and pages that need to be updated. This section will list the necessary instructions to ensure a smooth transition. 

## Steps for Major Release:

1. Update .NET reference on the Home page's `index.md`
1. Update .NET reference in `manual\gettings-started.md`
1. Update .NET reference in `manual\code-only\create-project.md`
1. Update `TargetFramework` in all `.csproj` files
1. Test all examples and ensure they work as expected
 
By following these steps, you can help ensure that each major release is well-documented and thoroughly tested, providing a smooth experience for all users of the toolkit.
