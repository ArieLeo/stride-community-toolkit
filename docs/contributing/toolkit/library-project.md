# New Library Project

### New NuGet Library

1. Create a project in the `src` folder, make sure to follow the naming convention `Stride.CommunityToolkit.<LibraryName>`. Check the [existing libraries](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit/tree/main/src) to see the folder structure.
1. Update `includes/libraries.md` with a name and description of the new library. This will show up on:
    - The home page
    - Getings Started page
