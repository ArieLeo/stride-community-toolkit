# Code Only

## Why Opt for Code-Only Over the Stride Editor?

There are numerous reasons to consider using the Code-Only approach, especially if:

- You prefer not to install additional software on your computer (Stride installation not required).
- Learn C# or game development in a straightforward, code-first manner.
- You're aiming for a quick start in game development or C# programming.
- You're eager to dive into C# or game development, finding joy and educational value in hands-on coding experiences, whether you're new or experienced.
- You wish to see tangible, visual 2D/3D outputs instead of just console-based results.
- You want to gradually ease into game programming, mastering the basics before diving into the complexities of a game editor.
- You find typical coding environments and tools too overwhelming to navigate.
- You'd like to prototype quickly and easily game elements.
- You want an efficient way to grasp fundamental game development concepts and practices.
- You're interested in evaluating performance and features of Stride Game Engine without the overhead of a full-fledged editor.
