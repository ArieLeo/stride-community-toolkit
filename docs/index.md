# Stride Community Toolkit Documentation

> [!NOTE]
> The Stride Community Toolkit is currently in development. Documentation is incomplete and may contain errors. We published it early for your convenience, ahead of the toolkit's completion.

The [Stride Community Toolkit](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit) is a comprehensive set of helpers and extensions designed to enhance your experience with the [Stride Game Engine](https://www.stride3d.net/). It simplifies and exemplifies routine development tasks 🛠️, enabling you to build applications for Stride using .NET with ease 🎉.

Available as a 📦 [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Stride.CommunityToolkit), the Stride Community Toolkit can be easily integrated into new or existing Stride Game C# projects. For more information on how to get started, please refer to the Getting Started page.

This toolkit serves as our preferred solution for rapid 🏃 prototyping and accelerated game development. Unlike the more stable Stride Game Engine, the Stride Community Toolkit aims for a faster development momentum. As such, **breaking changes** are not only likely but should be expected. This approach allows us to quickly iterate and integrate new features and improvements. We believe this pace serves the needs of developers who are looking for cutting-edge tools and are comfortable with a more dynamic environment.

Feel free to browse the documentation using the table of contents on the left side of this page.
