This code example demonstrates how to initialize a game, set up a basic 3D scene, create a 3D capsule entity, set its position, and add it to the scene using the Stride Game Engine. The capsule entity comes automatically equipped with a rigid body and a collider, thanks to the `CreatePrimitive()` method. It's a simple example that provides a starting point for building a game using Stride.
