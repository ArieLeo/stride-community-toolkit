# Adding a Texture at Runtime

In this tutorial, we will explore how to dynamically apply a texture to a 3D object in your Stride project. By using the `Texture` class, you can load an image file at runtime and assign it to a 3D entity. We will demonstrate how to do this by applying a texture to a cube.

## What You'll Learn
- How to load a texture from an image file at runtime.
- How to create and configure a `MaterialDescriptor` to apply the texture to a 3D object.
- How to create a 3D primitive (cube) and assign the texture as its material.
