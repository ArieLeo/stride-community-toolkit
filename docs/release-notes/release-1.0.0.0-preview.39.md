# What's new in Stride Community Toolkit 1.0.0.0-preview.20

This article lists the most significant changes in Stride Community Toolkit preview `1.0.0.0-preview.39`.

This release adds Bepu Physics integration, a new upcoming physics engine for Stride. Some of the new Bepu extensions are specific for code-only approach, while other can be used in the editor generated projects as well.

This update mainly focused on this issue https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit/issues/133.

I was able to debug the error but I wasn't able to find the issue itself because it happens in the NuGet library itself. I moved on and these are the suggetions for the toolkit for now:

Anywhere we reference `Stride.Core.Assets.CompilerApp` we have to add also `<RuntimeIdentifier>win-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>` which makes it Windows only. 

- `Stride.CommunityToolkit` library will have no `Stride.Core.Assets.CompilerApp` references, so it can be built correctly and be platfom agnostic. Should work in code-only and regular Stride Projects.
- The new `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Windows` library will have `Stride.Core.Assets.CompilerApp` reference and also `<RuntimeIdentifier>win-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>`, at the moment it is an empty library refrencing  `Stride.CommunityToolkit` project mainly for code-only purpose, just to remove the above boilerplate. That means, code only examples would reference  `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Windows` instead of  `Stride.CommunityToolkit`. This could be done also for Linux later.
- `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes` library mainly for code-only purpose, will have `Stride.Core.Assets.CompilerApp` reference removed so the NuGet package can be created. Because it is used with `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Windows`, it should build correctly
