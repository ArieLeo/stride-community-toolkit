# Release Notes

Welcome to the Release Notes for the **Stride Community Toolkit**. This section aims to provide you with an organized, high-level summary of changes, enhancements, and fixes made in each version release. If you're looking to understand what has changed from one version to the next, you're in the right place.

## What to Expect

The Stride Community Toolkit is developed with rapid iteration in mind. It moves at a faster development pace compared to the Stride Game Engine. As a result, you should expect frequent updates that may introduce breaking changes. This fast-paced approach allows us to incorporate community feedback quickly and continue improving the toolkit.
